#Concept

Originally I started off with the idea of a 2D fighting game using the sprites I like to make in my spare time. I really enjoyed making the sprites and felt it would give originality and a sense of me into the assignment. The chrarcter design took a lot of time outside processing but translating them into it created it's own challenges. Instead of using in game object I had to treat the Sprites as Images and work around them with that mentality. Only halfway into the assignment did I change the idea to a "Tag" style game. I felt it would be completely unique to what anyone else was doing and was a kind of beautiful simplicity. After testing the game with friends I found out that was the case.Although the project didn't match with my orginal concept I feel like the idea evolved for the better and still has the necessary depth.

#Key Features

-*Custom player sprites made from scratch and made in different poses to give a running animation*

-Help menu to show the controls

-Stage selection (choice between 3 Unique backgrounds)

-A fun multiplayer experience that's simple in nature but has hidden depth in the form of platforming and powerups

-An upbeat soundtrack that follows the flow of the game(8-Bit Threshold by Brian LeBarton -Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World)

#Controls

- D/RIGHT ARROW : To move right
- A/LEFT ARROW : To move left
- S/DOWN ARROW : To tag the other player
- W/UP ARROW : To Jump

#The Program

The program is split into several sections by a switch statement menu:

Main Menu:
- Allows the user to browse throught the multiple functions of the game
- Has alligned selection boxes(Not the chocolate kind)

Help Menu:
- The help menu shows the user(s) the base controls of the game for both players

Stage Menu:
- The stage menu allows the user(s) to choose between the three unique backgrounds available: Castle, Shore or Urban. All three stages bring a different theme/depth to the game. The game can be left to go back out and change the background at any time.

Play:
- This brings the user into the main game. Each player has a set of controls as listed above. The idea of the game is "tag". The player with the current arrow over their head is "tagged". This means the current player(Player 1) Has to get the Other player(Player2) into a close enough proximity to tag him/her. If achieved the "tagged" player changes and the chase continues. The Added speed up powerup that spawns on the top platform also adds a hidden depth. By nature a game of tag means the players are avoiding eachother. The adding of this powerup adds a contest for the players to race to to get a permanent(small enough that it's not broken) advantage over their opponent. Because of this a King of the Hill style event occurs at the start of every game, kind of like  a race with a risk. As well as the powerups the stage adds a platforming element to the game which adds a fun mix up to the game.
